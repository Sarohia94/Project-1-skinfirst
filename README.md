## Features

* Responsive on a range of device sizes
* All pages on the website have:
  * A navigation bar on all three pages to make it easy for the user to navigate the website. This is uniform across all pages consisting of the logo to the left and the links to the home, guide and sign up pages to the right.
  * A footer centered at the bottom of all three pages with icon links to social media; Twitter, Facebook, Instagram & Youtube. The links open on to a new tab so the user does not leave the skinfirst website.
