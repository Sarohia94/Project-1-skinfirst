## Features

* Responsive on a range of device sizes
* All pages on the website have:
  * A navigation bar on all three pages to make it easy for the user to navigate the website. This is uniform across all pages consisting of the logo to the left and the links to the home, guide and sign up pages to the right. Hovering over the links emboldens the the text and has an underline which remains once clicked on to highlight which page the user is currently on.
  * A footer centered at the bottom of all three pages with icon links to social media; Twitter, Facebook, Instagram & Youtube. The links open on to a new tab so the user does not leave the skinfirst website. As part of the intention for the website is to build a community, the social media links are important to encourage interaction. Hovering over the link increases the icon size to make it interactive.
* Home page
  * About us section will provide information to the user about the purpose of the website, some context on skin care and what they can expect to learn.
  * Image of a smiling woman (to the right on desktop and stacked on top on mobile/tablet) is used to set a warm, natural and welcoming aesthetic to the website. It also sets the tone on the feeling the website aims to inspire when visiting and thinking about skin wellness.
  * Fun facts aside to provide some interesting skin related information.
* Guide page
  * Morning and night routine. This section will provide the user with an easy to follow guide for skin wellness, with some rationale.
  * Other factors section. This will provide the user with other factors to consider such as lifestyle changes to promote skin wellness.
* Sign Up page
  * A reason on why the user will want to sign up, to be updated as we grow the website and to join the community which will later become an interactive forum with other members.
  * A sign up form, which will require the user to submit their full name and email address.
* Thank You page
  * A message thanking the user for signing up with a note reiterating our websites intention and a 30 second timer with a button too, to direct them back to the home page.
* Future features
  * Responsible buying section on the guide page. This will provide information to the user on what to look out for when purchasing products. This is to promote users into thinking about their purchasing power. This goes hand in hand with the postive thinking the website aims to inspire with skin wellness. As such, this section would further this with the consideration of societal & environmental benefits of using certain accredited skin care products.
  * Add links to the other factors section, making the text or icons clickable, to direct users to related articles or video content providing futher information on the benefits.
  * The sign up form can have a text box where the user can submit a query, comment or feedback. The other option to further this is to have a link to another page which acts as a interactive community forum for ideas to be shared and discussed amongst members.
  
### Accessibility 
The website achieves accessibility with:
* Semantic HTML
* Alt attribute on the image
* Information provided for screen readers where icons are used with no text
* Colour contrast, checked and sufficient
* Marking current page as current for screen readers

## Testing 
* Issues raised in my mid project meeting with my mentor:
  1. Layout used for bigger screen sizes on home page looked a little awkward so we discussed using the mobile landing image for all screen sizes but image was too pixelated. Using flex box to create a 3 column view seemed to improve the layout structure for screen sizes up to 1440px.
  ![Issue with layout for bigger screen sizes](docs/testing/issues/issues6.png)
  2. Remove "/" infront of the file paths, as relative path should be used for the images.
  3. Add meta tag for http-equiv, to the thankyou page to direct the user automatically back to the home page after a set time. Mentor [Chris Quinn](https://github.com/10xOXR) has been credited for the code. However, doing so showed as an issue by lowering the lighthouse accessibility score. To combat this I extended the time from 10s to 30s to allow for more reading and decision making time for the user on how to navigate away from the thankyou page. There is also a note left on the thankyou page warning the user they will be directed to the home page in 30s.
  ![Issue with lighthouse accessibility score following the include on the meta tag for http-equiv](docs/testing/issues/issues10.png)
* Issues faced before submitting my project for review on Slack:
  1. I have tested my website on mobile, tablet and desktop. I have tested on Samsung internet, Chrome and Microsoft Edge but need futher testing on different browsers.
* Issues raised as part of feedback from the peer code review on slack:
  1. The nav bar had a white background on all pages but the signup page. This was resolved after applying flex box to the body element. This was identified by [Lane-Sawyer Thompson](https://github.com/LaneSawyerT).
  ![Issue with the nav bar on the signup page](docs/testing/issues/issues8.png)
  2. Issue with day and night routine not being centered on bigger screen sizes, resulting in a larger gap on the right. This was resolved by floating left the morning routine and floating right the night routine, setting the width as 45%. This was identified by [Anya McDonald](https://github.com/anyahush).
  ![Issue with day and night routine not being centered on bigger screen sizes](docs/testing/issues/issues9.png)
  3. Issue with the footer not sticking to the bottom of the page and as such leaving a gap. This was resolved by using flex box on the body and setting a margin top on the footer. The code for this was obtained from [here](https://dev.to/nehalahmadkhan/how-to-make-footer-stick-to-bottom-of-web-page-3i14). This was identified by [Anya McDonald](https://github.com/anyahush).
  4. Issue with the hover effect on the social media icons. Where all icons would react when you are switching between the links. This was identified by [Anya McDonald](https://github.com/anyahush). I had tried playing around with the code to target the icons but I was unable to resolve this. Mentor [Chris Quinn](https://github.com/10xOXR), suggested applying the transition styling with 0.3s and ease-in-out. This seemed to have improved the jumping effect on the icons.
  ![Issue with the hover effect causing all social media icons to react when switching between them](docs/testing/issues/hovereffectissue.gif)
* Final issues raised following the end project meeting with my mentor:
  1. Mentor [Chris Quinn](https://github.com/10xOXR) suggested that a Favicon icon would be a nice addition to the webpage. This was applied by creating the design and following the instructions from [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) website.

### W3C Validator 
No issues with the HTML pages or CSS:

### Solved Bugs
Issues faced and resolved before my mid project meeting:
  1. Adding media queries to make website pages responsive. Initially started by building with the desktop view in mind so lost time when reworking to build mobile first as discussed with my mentor in our first project meeting.
  2. Struggled to make my landing images responsive and proportional. Using specificity on the image tag and setting the height, width and object-fit seemed to resolve the issue.
  ![Issue with the landing image not being in proportion to the about us section](docs/testing/issues/issues1.png)
  ![Issue with landing image 2 in proportion to the about us section for larger screen sizes](docs/testing/issues/issues2.png)
  3. The other factors section would break on smaller screen sizes due to the size of the icons in proportion the box. This was resolved by have the boxes stacked on top of each other for smaller screen sizes and amending the padding.
  ![Issue with the size of boxes and the icon spilling out](docs/testing/issues/issues3.png)
  4. Lighthouse and colour contrast check on [Coolers](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/af9e42-ffffff) showed poor accessibility for font colour #AF9E42 against white or light coloured backgrounds so this was amended to #6A3929.
  ![Issue with color contrast as evidenced by Coolers](docs/testing/issues/issues4.png)
  5. Below error message appeared due to an alt attribute being included in the source tag which was not required. Looking in to this further with tutor [Gemma Sayers](https://github.com/GJSayers) on Slack it seems for now nothing more can be done for accessibility using the source tag.
  ![Issue with using an unrequired alt attribute on the source tag](docs/testing/issues/issues5.png)

### Known Bugs
  1. On screen sizes 1600px and upwards there is increasingly free space below the about us and fun facts aside. Another media query can be added to reconfigure the layout or add further content in these sections such as videos. Due to time constaints this may be something to be worked on and improved later.
  ![Issue with layout and free space on screen sizes larger than 1600px](docs/testing/issues/issues7.png)
